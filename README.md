# Pclub_MookitScraping
This is my submission for the task Mookit-Scraping

Libraries include <i><b>RegEx</b></i> and <i><b>BeautifulSoup</b></i>.



The python code takes user input of the number of latest lectures that the user wishes to view and store it in <b>CSV</b> format. It then checks if the number of lectures are specified are greater than total lectures. If it is, then it exits from the program else it continues.

I calculated the total number of lectures using a for loop and BeautifulSoup

I used <strong><i>RegEx</i></strong> to differentiate between week and lecture name.
The code uses a variable to count how may lectures are remaining and starts entering it into CSV file as soon as it equals to the input given by user.

Finally the details are entered into a CSV file and also displayed for the user.
